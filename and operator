print(0 and 1)
//we all know it will return 0

print(1 and 1)
// It will return 1

print(3 and 5)
//It will return 5

print(5 and 3)
//It will return 3

//The last 2 print statements are so because we have never tried to understand how the and operator works.
// and operator:- It will return the first false value and if not found it will return the last value.
//3 and 5 both are true values therefore the and operator returns the last true value in each case.
